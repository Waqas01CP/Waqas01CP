# Hi there, I'm Waqas Sharif. 👋

### Final-Year Software Engineering Student | Agentic AI & Multi-Agent Systems
**Bridging the gap between deterministic software architecture and probabilistic Generative AI.**

🟢 **Status:** Open to Remote Internships & Part-Time AI/ML Roles.

I am a Software Engineering undergraduate applying formal engineering principles—SDLC, Object-Oriented Design, and Formal Methods—to the wild west of AI development. I treat Large Language Models (LLMs) not as magic boxes, but as stochastic components that require deterministic guardrails and structured orchestration.

### 🧠 The "Lab" Approach
My work focuses on two core engineering pillars:

| **The Builder (Agentic Systems)** | **The Researcher (LLM Reliability)** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Architecting **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)** that solve complex workflows using **Google ADK** and **Session Isolation** protocols. | Conducting behavioral meta-analysis on **Google Gemini** via AI Studio to diagnose failure modes like "Final Synthesis Bias." |
| *Focus: Orchestration, Latency, State Management* | *Focus: Red Teaming, Context Engineering, Workflow Architecture* |
